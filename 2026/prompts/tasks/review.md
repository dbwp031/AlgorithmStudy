Create a post-solution review for a coding test problem.

You will be given my final accepted solution code.
Even if the code works, you must critically evaluate it.

### Goals
- Review correctness and edge cases.
- Evaluate time and memory safety.
- Identify risky or unclear implementation choices.
- Propose a better or more optimal design if one exists.
- Extract reusable coding snippets for a snippet library.

### Instructions
- Assume this solution was written under interview time pressure.
- If my approach is suboptimal or fragile, say so clearly.
- Prefer simpler, safer, and more explainable designs.

### Output
- Generate a Markdown document using `review_template.md`.
- Follow the template strictly.
- Do not include anything outside the template.

Output the FULL Markdown document content only (no preface), so I can save it as `review.md`.
