I am stuck while solving a coding test problem.

Your task is to help me unblock without immediately giving away the solution.

### Goals
1. Diagnose what is wrong or missing in my current approach.
2. Explain why my reasoning or implementation fails.
3. Provide help in progressive levels:
   - Hint only
   - Guided fix
   - Final optimal solution
4. Extract any reusable snippet learned from this process.

### Instructions
- Be precise about invariants and failure points.
- Do not jump directly to the full solution unless required by the template.
- Assume I want to learn, not just pass.

### Output
- Generate a Markdown document using `unblock_template.md`.
- Follow the template strictly.
- Do not include anything outside the template.

Output the FULL Markdown document content only (no preface), so I can save it as `unblock.md`.
